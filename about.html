              <h1>About Terracoin and the TRC Foundation</h1>
              <<p>Terracoin is a cryptocurrency that was created by an anonymous developer on October 26th 2012, and eventually fell into a state of abandonment. Out of love for the coin The Terracoin Foundation took over development and support of Terracoin on February 13th 2016.</p>
              <p>Originally Terracoin was very similar to Bitcoin, but since that time The Terracoin Foundation has implemented merged mining, Dark Gravity Wave difficulty recalculations, decentralized governance, masternodes, and a dedication to helping the world.</p>
              <p>The Terracoin Foundationâ€™s mission is to help the world while we continue to improve the technology Terracoin uses.  We believe that blockchain technology can be used as an instrument to improve the world while we also create an innovative, flexible, secure and easier to use alternative to both Bitcoin and fiat currencies.</p>
